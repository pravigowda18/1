# Data Structure and Algorithm Repository

Welcome to the **Data Structure and Algorithm** repository! This collection is designed to be your go-to resource for mastering data structures and algorithms, whether you're preparing for technical interviews or just brushing up on foundational concepts.

## Overview

This repository covers a wide range of data structures and algorithms, implemented primarily in C++. Each topic includes detailed explanations, code implementations, and examples to help you understand the principles and applications of each algorithm.

## Contents

- **Arrays and Vectors**: Basic operations, sorting, and searching algorithms.
- **Linked Lists**: Implementation and operations for singly, doubly, and circular linked lists.
- **Stacks and Queues**: Data structures for LIFO and FIFO operations.
- **Trees**: Binary trees, AVL trees, and various tree traversal algorithms.
- **Graphs**: BFS, DFS, Dijkstra's algorithm, and other graph-based algorithms.
- **Dynamic Programming**: Classic DP problems like the Knapsack problem, Longest Increasing Subsequence, and more.
- **Sorting Algorithms**: Implementation of sorting algorithms such as Quick Sort, Merge Sort, and Heap Sort.
- **Backtracking**: Solutions to problems like N-Queens, Sudoku, and others.
  
## Getting Started

To use this repository, simply clone it to your local machine using:

```bash
